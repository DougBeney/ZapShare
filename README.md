This is a fork of [Opencast Studio](https://github.com/elan-ev/opencast-studio).

My plan is to modernize the UI, remove OpenCast integration, add YouTube/Amazon S3 uploading, and add some nice features like putting the webcam on the corner of the screen.

It's goal is to be a lightweight [Loom](https://www.loom.com/) alternative that works on all web browsers. Users may self host it. I may also offer my own paid subscription plan for users that don't want to host it themselves and want to support development - and can offer additional features like whitelabeling. There will also be a free version (no accounts needed) on the main website if this works like I think it might.

License changed from MIT to GPLv3.

Hopefully I do not abandon this project.
